# Options Strategy Risk & Reward Analyzer | Aries React Challenge


This project is a front-end application designed to visualize the risk and reward of options strategies. It allows users to input up to four options contracts and generates a corresponding risk & reward graph. This tool also calculates and displays the maximum profit, maximum loss, and all break-even points based on the options contracts provided.


## Features

- **Graphical Analysis**: Displays a risk & reward graph plotting the potential profit or loss across a range of underlying prices at expiration.

- **Calculation of Metrics**: Automatically calculates and displays the maximum profit, maximum loss, and break-even points.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
- **React-ApexCharts**: A React wrapper for ApexCharts to build interactive visualizations.

## Project Setup
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally:

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (preferably version 18.x or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

#### Installation
- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chamiSG/aries-react-challenge.git
cd aries-react-challenge
```

- Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```
- Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
This command starts the local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Usage
To use the application, navigate to the web interface (usually at http://localhost:5173 when running locally). The graph and calculated metrics will update automatically based on the data provided.
